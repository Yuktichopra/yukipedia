            <p>My academic journey has been one of exploration—from computer science to neuroscience, with many fascinating stops along the way. I began by studying how emerging technologies could impact diverse fields, immersing myself in projects spanning astrophysics, game design, and artificial intelligence during my undergraduate years. Each experience underscored the power of interdisciplinary approaches, ultimately guiding me toward the intricate, compelling world of neuroscience.</p>

            <p>Today, as a doctoral student at SISSA (the International School for Advanced Studies), my research focuses on understanding how memories shape our perceptions of the world around us. I investigate perceptual biases in memory, aiming to decipher how the brain uses past experiences to inform our current perceptions. Using tools like EEG, I work to map how these biases manifest within the brain and to develop a framework explaining the deep interconnection between memory and perception.</p>

            <p>What captivates me about neuroscience is that, while relatively young compared to disciplines like physics, it grapples with one of the most profound questions of existence—how we perceive and make sense of reality. Neuroscience doesn’t just ask “How do we function?” but “Who are we, at our core?” By delving into the biological roots of perception, identity, and consciousness, it uncovers the essence of humanity and connects our understanding of self with our place in society.</p>

            <p>Beyond my primary research, I’m intrigued by what brain imaging can reveal about consciousness—how our sense of self and agency can shift, and how foundational concepts like body ownership and self-location come into play. I'm also deeply curious about how techniques such as Electrical Brain Stimulation (EBS) might one day unlock new insights into the nature of consciousness itself or even allow us to modify aspects of perception. Although this isn’t my main area of research, these advancements inspire me and broaden my perspective on the vast potential of brain science.</p>

            <p>I'm particularly passionate about the future of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), a technology with transformative potential that feels almost boundless. BCIs have the capacity to redefine how humans interact with machines—and each other—by enabling new forms of communication and accessibility. I believe we stand at the brink of a future where BCIs offer unparalleled opportunities for human enhancement, engagement, and interaction.</p>

            <p>Equally important to me is the communication of science itself. I am committed to making the complexities of brain science accessible and engaging, aiming not just to inspire others to join this incredible field, but to share the wonders and transformative potential of the brain. I hope to reach bright minds and audiences across disciplines, inviting them to marvel at the brain's capabilities and consider its potential to transform our lives. The brain holds extraordinary secrets—about reality, our mental well-being, and our emotional lives—and if we study and harness its power effectively, it could provide answers to some of our most pressing challenges.</p>

            <p>By bridging neuroscience and communication, I aim to foster a broader understanding of this incredible field, revealing the brain not just as a subject of study, but as the key to unlocking deeper truths about ourselves and our world.</p>
